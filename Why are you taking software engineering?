Why are you taking Software Engineering and what you hope to get out the class
I am taking this class partially because it is a required course for me to graduate. I am also taking it because I think it is an important step in learning how to be a better programmer and prepare me for the workforce. I am not yet quite sure what I want to do as a career, and if it will even involve computer science in a traditional sense, but I know I enjoy coding and trying to figure out a solution to a difficult problem. I hope that I can learn how to hone these abilities into something productive. I want to be able to better understand the development process and continue to add valuable skills to my arsenal.
