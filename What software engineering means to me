  To me software engineering is the backbone of what most people think of as computer science. It involves a lot of coding and designing programs. This is where apps and websites are developed. Software engineering means the ability to interact with tons of different kinds of tech and watching as things continue to become more sophisticated. The innovation that comes at the hands of many different types of people and companies comes from software engineering. Software engineering means testing, working, and developing different ideas so that the end user is satisfied with its interface. To me, most importantly, software engineering means interacted with my computer in new and exciting ways.
